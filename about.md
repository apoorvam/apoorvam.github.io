My name is **Apoorva** and I am a developer from Bangalore, India. I graduated in 2014 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Visvesvaraya Technological University.

I work for **[ThoughtWorks Studios](https://www.thoughtworks.com/products)** on **[Gauge](http://getgauge.io)** team, it's a light-weight cross-platform test automation tool and provides the ability to author test cases in Markdown.

Computers are fascinating machines, but they're mostly a reflection of the people using them. I consider programming as an Art and I love to code. Apart from coding, I love music, especially Indian Classical music. Over the course of my life, I’ve embraced a number of different hobbies, now Blogging to the list.
