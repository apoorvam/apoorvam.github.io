<p>My name is <bold>Apoorva</bold> and I am a developer from Bangalore, India. I graduated in 2014 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Visvesvaraya Technological University.</p>

<p>I work for <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/products">ThoughtWorks Studios</a> on <a href="http://getgauge.io">Gauge</a> team, it's a light-weight cross-platform test automation tool and provides the ability to author test cases in Markdown.</p>

<p>Computers are fascinating machines, but they're mostly a reflection of the people using them. I consider programming as an Art and I love to code. Apart from coding, I love music, especially Indian Classical music. Over the course of my life, Iâ€™ve embraced a number of different hobbies, now Blogging to the list.</p>
