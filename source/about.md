I am Apoorva, a full stack software engineer interested in Distributed Systems, Product Development and Data. I graduated in 2014 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangalore Institute of Technology.

At <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/products" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks Studios</a>, I worked on a open source products like <a href="https://gauge.org/" target="_blank">Gauge</a>, which is a light-weight cross-platform test automation tool that takes the pain out of acceptance testing. Gauge core is written in Golang and has plugin-based architecture with plugins for multiple language support, IDE plugins, reporting etc. I also worked on a project for <a href="https://www.go-jek.com/" target="_blank">GoJek</a>'s online food delivery platform, GoFood. 

In my free time I try to learn something, make artistic things, listen music, travel and go hiking.
