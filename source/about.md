This is Apoorva Manjunath, a full stack software developer interested in Distributed Systems, Product Development and Data. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science degree from Northeastern University, Boston, United States. I graduated in 2014 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangalore Institute of Technology.

As a Research Assistant at <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/amylu/lab/index.html" target="_blank">Health Technology Lab</a> of Northeastern University, I help the group with data processing by simplyfying and speeding the arrangement and processing of the participantsâ€™ heart rate and physical activity level data.

At <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/products" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks Studios</a>, I worked on open source products like <a href="https://gauge.org/" target="_blank">Gauge</a>, which is a light-weight cross-platform test automation tool that takes the pain out of acceptance testing. Gauge core is written in Golang and has plugin-based architecture with plugins for multiple language support, IDE plugins, reporting etc. I also worked on a project for <a href="https://www.go-jek.com/" target="_blank">GoJek</a>'s online food delivery platform, GoFood. 

Technology has made our lives safer, cleaner, healthier, fairer and more productive. I am interested in leveraging the best that technology has to offer and connecting technology back to social and human creativity. I am keen on working at the intersection of Technology and Creativity. I also envision building products that can impact the lives of people to a greater extent.

When not coding, I like to make DIY crafts, listen to music(esp classical music) and travel.
